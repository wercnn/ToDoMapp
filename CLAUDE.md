# CLAUDE.md

Backend for a goal-driven planning platform: User → Goal → Project → Work Package →
Task, projected onto a day-granular roadmap with a points/streak motivation layer.
API-first; clients hold zero business logic.

**Authoritative spec lives in `/docs`** — read these for any detail, don't infer:
- `project-foundation.md` — what/why; §8 Decision Log is authoritative.
- `data-model.md` — Postgres schema; §2–§4 are the source of truth for tables.
- `api-endpoints.md` — the REST surface, grouped by resource.

## Locked decisions (do not re-litigate)
- TypeScript on **Next.js App Router** API routes, deployed to Vercel.
- **Supabase** (Postgres + Auth). The auto-generated **Data API is OFF** — our Next.js
  API is the only thing that reads/writes domain tables.
- DB access via **Kysely**. Migrations are **plain SQL files in git** (Supabase CLI layout).
  Schema is hand-written SQL, NOT generated from TS; `src/db/types.ts` is kept in lockstep by hand.
- Connections: pooled (6543) for the app, session/direct (5432) for migrations — both from `.env`.
- **Capacity = per-project hours/day** for v1, but passed to the planner as a *parameter*
  (`ProjectCapacity[]`), never hard-wired, so a per-day model can replace it later.
- **Planner behind a narrow interface**: `proposeDays(input) → DraftDay[]` (pure, no I/O).
  Nothing outside `src/planner` depends on how it works.
- **All multi-table writes go through `withTransaction`** (`src/db/transaction.ts`).
- **Tenancy from the JWT** in auth middleware: subject → `app_user.auth_subject` → workspace
  via `workspace_member`. `workspace_id` is injected server-side, NEVER from the client.
  Cross-workspace access → 404.
- **Scoring is idempotent**: each source scores once ever (app check + partial unique indexes).

## Project map
- `src/auth/` — `verifier.ts` (swappable token verify; JWKS/ES256 via Supabase signing keys,
  derived from `SUPABASE_URL` — no shared secret), `context.ts` (requireAuth → workspace ctx).
- `src/db/` — `kysely.ts` (pooled handle + pg type parsers), `types.ts` (hand-written DB types),
  `transaction.ts` (the one tx helper).
- `src/lib/` — `errors.ts` (ApiError + pg-error mapping), `http.ts` (route wrapper), `dates.ts` (midnight-local).
- `src/planner/` — `types.ts` (interface), `index.ts` (v1 fill-to-capacity), `constants.ts` (difficulty→hours).
- `src/domain/` — business logic: `bootstrap`, `goals`, `projects`, `workPackages`, `tasks`,
  `completion` (the cascade) + `scoring`, `engagement`, `roadmap`, `blocked`, `validation`,
  `replan/` (proposal pipeline: `analyze` diff producer, `apply` transactional apply + #4/#5
  guards, `proposals` service, `types`; consumes the pure planner, never lives inside it).
- `src/app/v1/` — route handlers (one folder per endpoint). URL base path is `/v1`
  (in App Router the URL mirrors the folder, so routes live under `app/v1`, not `app/api`).
- `src/testing/fixtures.ts` — `provisionWorkspace` / `seedScenario` / `teardownWorkspace` (shared by tests + seed).
- `supabase/migrations/` — numbered SQL migrations (initial schema + point_rule seed).
- `scripts/` — `migrate.ts`, `seed.ts`, `env.ts` (dotenv loader for scripts/tests).
- `tests/` — `completion.test.ts` (DB-backed; runs against the configured Supabase DB).

## Commands
- `npm run migrate` — apply pending SQL migrations (uses `DIRECT_URL`). `-- --status` to list.
- `npm run seed` — (re)create the seed workspace + scenario. `-- --reset` to only delete it.
- `npm test` — run the completion-cascade tests (DB-backed; needs `DIRECT_URL`).
- `npm run dev` — Next dev server. `npm run build` / `npm run typecheck` — verify.

## Known deviations from the docs
- **`point_event` source CHECK relaxed to `<= 1`** (not `= 1`). The doc states both exactly-one-source
  AND `ON DELETE SET NULL` on sources; those conflict (SET NULL on a scored task would violate `=1`
  and block the delete). We keep `<= 1` + a type↔source *family* agreement CHECK, preserving the real
  guard while letting the append-only ledger survive source deletion. See the migration comment.
- **`DIRECT_URL` points at the session pooler (5432)**, not `db.<ref>.supabase.co` — that direct host
  is IPv6-only and unreachable from many networks/CI. Session mode still supports DDL + transactions.

## Build state
See `docs/PROGRESS.md` for the live checklist. In short: the 8-endpoint vertical spine +
the task-completion cascade are built and pass against Supabase. Dependencies, the flow
diagram, and the replanning pipeline (Phase 4) are now built too. The slippage detector
job (Phase 5), notifications, and most read endpoints are NOT built yet.
